    "# Fine-tune Llama-3.1 8B with Llama-Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama-3.1 8B large language model (LLM) on AMD ROCm GPUs by leveraging Llama-Factory. Efficient fine-tuning is vital for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, non-trivial efforts are required to implement these methods on different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Llama-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) is a unified framework that integrates a suite of cutting-edge, efficient training methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a solution for flexibly customizing the fine-tuning of over 100 LLMs without the need for coding through the built-in web UI LLAMABOARD."

    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AMD Instinct™ GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.3**: Install and verify ROCm by following the [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    amd-smi\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command lists your AMD GPUs with relevant details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the `rocm-smi` command instead.\n",
