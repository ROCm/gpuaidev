    "# RL training with slime on AMD GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern large language models don't stop improving after pretraining. To be useful, aligned, and robust for real-world tasks, they must learn from feedback. That's where Reinforcement Learning (RL) comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through a real, production-style RL training pipeline for the [Qwen3-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B) large language model, running entirely on AMD GPUs with ROCm. The workflow is powered by [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime), an SGLang-native post-training framework built specifically for RL scaling at LLM scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use slime?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training LLMs with RL is challenging for two key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rollout generation is expensive**:\n",
    "   You need a fast inference engine to sample large volumes of model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Policy optimization is heavy**:\n",
    "   You need a highly optimized training stack that scales across GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) addresses both challenges by cleanly separating and efficiently connecting these two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SGLang**: For high-throughput rollout generation\n",
    "- **Megatron-LM**: For distributed policy training\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they form a scalable, modular RL system that aligns with modern LLM workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is GRPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), a modern RL algorithm designed for scalable LLM training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RL methods often rely on a single reference baseline, also known as a critic model, which can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expensive to train\n",
    "- Hard to stabilize\n",
    "- Sensitive to reward noise\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO takes a different approach. Instead of evaluating a response in isolation, GRPO:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Samples multiple responses for the same prompt\n",
    "- Groups them together\n",
    "- Computes relative advantages within the group\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters for LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO offers several practical advantages:\n",
    "- No separate value network required\n",
    "- More stable training signals\n",
    "- Better scaling behavior for large batch rollouts\n",
    "- Naturally fits server-based rollout generation (SGLang)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes GRPO especially well-suited for:\n",
    "- Instruction tuning\n",
    "- Reasoning improvement\n",
    "- Preference-based optimization\n",
    "- Large-scale RL on multi-GPU systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a ROCm-enabled Docker environment for slime on AMD GPUs\n",
    "- Configure GRPO for Qwen3-4B, including rollout and reward settings\n",
    "- Run an end-to-end RL training loop, combining:\n",
    "  - SGLang for generation\n",
    "  - Megatron-LM for optimization\n",
    "- Understand the system-level design choices behind scalable LLM RL training\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're experimenting with post-training research or building production-grade RL pipelines, this notebook is designed to give you both working code and clear mental models. Let's get started."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! By working through this GRPO training tutorial with slime, you learned how to train large language models using reinforcement learning on AMD GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment setup**: ROCm-enabled Docker containers with slime provide a complete RL training environment.\n",
    "- **Checkpoint management**: Converting between Hugging Face and Megatron formats enables seamless integration across frameworks.\n",
    "- **GRPO training**: Group-relative advantages provide stable RL training without requiring a separate value network.\n",
    "- **Scalable architecture**: SGLang rollout generation and Megatron-LM policy optimization work together efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment with different datasets**: Apply GRPO to other reasoning or instruction-following datasets.\n",
    "2. **Tune hyperparameters**: Adjust the learning rate, KL coefficients, or sampling strategies for your specific use case.\n",
    "3. **Scale to larger models**: Use the same workflow with larger Qwen models or other LLM architectures.\n",
    "4. **Evaluate trained models**: Test your fine-tuned models on downstream tasks to measure improvement.\n",
