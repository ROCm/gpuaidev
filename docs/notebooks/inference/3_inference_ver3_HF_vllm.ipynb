    "vLLM is an open-source library designed to deliver high throughput and low latency for large language model (LLM) inference. It optimizes text generation workloads by efficiently batching requests and making full use of GPU resources, empowering developers to manage complex tasks like code generation and large-scale conversational AI.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AMD Instinct GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.2 or 6.3**: Install and verify ROCm by following the [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    amd-smi\n",

    "\n",
    "    This command lists your AMD GPUs with relevant details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the `rocm-smi` command instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   newgrp docker\n",
    "   ```\n",

Ensure the notebook file is either copied to this directory before running the Docker command or uploaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment after it starts.

    "\n",
    "You'll require a Hugging Face API token to access meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Generate your token at Hugging Face Tokens and request access for [meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). Tokens typically start with \"hf_\".\n",
