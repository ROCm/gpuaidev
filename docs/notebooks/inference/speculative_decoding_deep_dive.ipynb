    "# Speculative decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to achieve an efficiency speedup by enabling speculative decoding in LLM serving. It uses vLLM, one of the most commonly used open-source LLM frameworks, as the serving engine. The tutorial conducts all the benchmark and analysis on AMD Instinct™ MI300X GPUs and the AMD ROCm software stack. For a basic understanding of speculative decoding, including usage guidelines, see the [vLLM Speculative Decoding blog](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/vllm-x-amd-highly-efficient-llm-inference-on-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "vLLM can be up to 2.3 times faster when enabled with speculative decoding. In this tutorial, you'll use Llama-3.1 70B as the base model and Llama-3.1 1B as the draft model, comparing their serving performance with and without speculative decoding enabled. The tutorial provides detailed steps to reproduce the performance gain on AMD MI300X GPUs.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "- **AMD Instinct™ GPU(s)**: This tutorial has been tested on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.2+**: Install and verify ROCm by following the [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   amd-smi\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command lists your AMD GPUs with relevant details.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the `rocm-smi` command instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   newgrp docker\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   docker run hello-world\n",

    "### Hugging Face API access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain an API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) for downloading models.\n",
    "* Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access the [Meta Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).\n",

    "### 3. Provide your Hugging Face token\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll require a Hugging Face API token to access Llama-3.1. Generate your token at [Hugging Face Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and request access for [Llama-3.1 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). Tokens typically start with \"hf_\". \n",
