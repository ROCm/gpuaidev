    "# Accelerating DeepSeek-V3 inference using multi-token prediction in SGLang\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 have been two of the most popular LLMs. However, serving such large models is time consuming, due to the large number of parameters involved. Speculative decoding employs a smaller draft model to predict a few draft future tokens, which reduces the time and cost to directly leverage a large base model for each token prediction. This is one of the most feasible and effective techniques to accelerate the efficiency of LLM serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering whether you can adopt a speculative decoding module for DeepSeek-V3/R1 inference, and the answer is yes. The multi-token prediction (MTP) module is one of the most suitable options. It was initially introduced to enhance the training performance of DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, and its weights have been optimized along with the pre-training of the corresponding DeepSeek model. This saves extra training resources such as GPU usage and the time required for dataset preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step-by-step tutorial, you'll learn how to launch an LLM service with MTP enabled. By comparing the inference performance of the service with and without MTP enabled, you can observe how MTP is more efficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "With multi-token prediction (MTP) enabled, this variant of speculative decoding empowers the serving of DeepSeek-R1. Rather than leveraging the DeepSeek-R1 base model for each future token prediction, the MTP module (the draft model in speculative decoding) is first employed for drafting multiple future tokens. The lightweight nature of MTP results in a lower consumption of computing resources. After receiving the draft tokens, the base model, such as DeepSeek-R1 in this case, is then leveraged to verify the correctness of these draft candidates by a single pass. This workflow saves the time required by the heavy base model to predict each token by employing a lighter draft model to predict multiple draft tokens through multiple passes and leveraging the base model for one-time verification. After following this tutorial and enabling this feature, you should be able to observe similar performance gains to those shown in Figure 2. You're welcome to provide feedback and comments on this tutorial."
