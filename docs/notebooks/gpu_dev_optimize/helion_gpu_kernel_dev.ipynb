    "# Helion DSL for GPU kernel development and assessment on AMD GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "[Helion](https://github.com/pytorch/helion) is a Python-embedded domain-specific language (DSL) from Meta for authoring machine learning kernels. It compiles down to [Triton](https://openai.com/index/triton/), a performant backend from OpenAI for programming GPUs and other devices. Helion aims to raise the level of abstraction compared to Triton, making it easier to write correct and efficient kernels, while enabling greater automation in the autotuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helion can be viewed as either PyTorch with tiles or as a higher-level Triton application. Compared to Triton, Helion reduces manual coding effort through autotuning. Helion spends more time (approximately 10 minutes) autotuning as it evaluates hundreds of potential Triton implementations generated from a single Helion kernel. This larger search space also makes kernels more performance portable between different hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helion is supported by AMD GPUs. This tutorial demonstrates how to set up the Helion development environment, implement a Helion kernel, and benchmark performance with Triton and Torch on AMD Instinct™ GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Helion autotuner\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differentiator of Helion is its automated, ahead-of-time (AOT) autotuning engine. In Triton, developers are responsible for manually defining the search space for optimizations. This requires explicitly enumerating every configuration to be tested, a tedious process that limits the scope of exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helion changes this dynamic by using implicit search spaces. The high-level language automatically constructs a vast, multi-dimensional search space over the implementation choices. For example, a single `hl.tile` call implicitly instructs the autotuner to explore different block sizes and loop orderings and consider whether to flatten the iteration space into a single dimension. One Helion kernel definition can therefore map to thousands of Triton configurations, allowing the autotuner to create a much larger and richer search space in which to discover a superior configuration.\n",

    "The softmax function is often used in classification CNN models and even transformer-based LLM models. It converts raw output scores, also known as logits, into probabilities by normalizing the exponential of each value by dividing it by the sum of all the exponentials. This process ensures that the output values are in the range (0,1) and sum up to 1, making them interpretable as probabilities. PyTorch has implemented the softmax function as [a standard API](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html).\n",

    "According to the softmax algorithm definition, the Triton kernel implements the naive version (Equation 2). The kernel requires two for loops to obtain the maximum data and the corresponding sum of all the exponentials and an additional for loop to calculate the final softmax result. So it uses three loops altogether. The Safe Softmax algorithm is more fully described in [Online normalizer calculation for softmax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02867).\n",

    "#### Implementation of Triton fused-softmax\n",
    "Triton provides a reference softmax sample named `fused-softmax`. Based on online softmax, it simplifies the maximum data calculation to remove one for loop. It also asks the compiler to use more threads per row by increasing the number of warps. This is often tuned for better performance. Finally, it bases the kernel launch scheme on the GPU hardware properties, resulting in higher GPU kernel occupancy and better performance.\n"
