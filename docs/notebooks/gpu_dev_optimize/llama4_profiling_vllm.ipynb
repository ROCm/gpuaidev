    "# Profiling Llama-4 inference with vLLM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling is essential for understanding the performance bottlenecks in large language model inference pipelines. This tutorial walks you through the process of profiling the **Llama-4 Scout-17B-16E-Instruct** model using the vLLM framework on AMD GPUs with ROCm. You'll capture detailed kernel traces and later visualize them using Perfetto.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access to the gated **Llama-4 Scout-17B-16E-Instruct** model\n",
    "- Access to **Perfetto UI** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AMD GPUs**: Ensure you are using an AMD GPU, such as the Instinct™ MI300X or Radeon Pro W7900, with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",

To visualize it, use [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/), a powerful trace viewer built for large-scale profiling data. This helps uncover latency bottlenecks, CPU–GPU overlap, and kernel-level inefficiencies in your inference pipeline. To visualize the trace, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).\n",
    "2. Click **\"Open trace file\"**.\n",

    "![image_0](../assets/image_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the prefill and decode timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Now zoom into the trace to interpret what each slice reveals about the Llama-4 execution stages. Here's a close-up of two important process timelines captured in Perfetto:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The focus of this section is on the first two tracks: `python3 3906` and `python3 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `python3 3906`: Asynchronous CPU calls\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **orange slice** under `python3 3906` shows the execution of high-level model code on the CPU. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Calls like `execute_model`, `forward`, and `hipMemcpyWithStream`\n",
    "   - PyTorch internals such as `aten::to` and `aten::copy_`\n",
    "   - The actual forward pass for `Llama4ForCausalLM` and memory transfers\n",
    "\n",
    "   This slice reflects the CPU-side orchestration of inference, from input preparation to dispatching kernels to the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `python3 2`: GPU kernel timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **pink slice** under `python3 2` is where GPU kernel execution is visualized. This slice represents actual compute work being done by the GPU after the CPU enqueues the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here’s the key insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  There is a clear gap between two bursts of kernel execution.\n",
    "   -  This gap separates two distinct phases:\n",
    "      - **Before the gap**: This is the \"prefill\" stage, where the initial prompt is encoded, and attention and cache states are populated.\n",
    "      - **After the gap**: This is the \"decode\" stage, where the model generates tokens, typically using cached key/value tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding kernel timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When you expand the `python3 2` timeline in Perfetto, you’ll see two distinct GPU streams representing different types of operations executed on the device:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../assets/image_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This zoomed-in view helps you distinguish between computation kernels and communication operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Stream `3 3`: All GPU kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "   Stream `3 3` is the **primary compute stream**, where all GPU kernel executions are scheduled. This includes:\n",
    "   - `MatMul` and GEMM operations\n",
    "   - Fused MLP and attention blocks\n",
    "   - Positional encodings and LayerNorms\n",
    "   - Any fused or element-wise kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "   This stream is densely packed, showing the bulk of the model inference activities The rhythm and spacing of these kernels help diagnose things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Load balancing across tensor parallel ranks\n",
    "   - Gaps between kernel launches\n",
    "   - Prefill versus decode phases (based on the density before and after the gaps)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Stream `3 8`: AllGather kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "   Stream `3 8` is used specifically for **AllGather** operations, which are part of the tensor parallel communication process. These kernels:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Synchronize activations across devices in multi-GPU setups\n",
    "   - Typically occur between layer boundaries\n",
    "   - Are crucial in `tp=8` setups for syncing partial outputs across eight shards\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Zoom in to analyze the attention forward kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is at the heart of all Transformer-based language models and Llama-4 is no exception. Profiling its **attention forward kernel** gives us critical insights into its computational efficiency. Dive into the trace to inspect it at the kernel level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zoom into the kernel timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to `python3 2` and then to `stream 3 3` in the Perfetto UI.\n",
    "- Scroll with the mouse or drag to zoom into a cluster of dense kernels.\n",
    "- Hover over one of the prominent kernels. You should see a label like `_fwd_kernel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example image from the trace:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../assets/image_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the kernel slice\n",
    "\n",
    "From the **details** panel below the trace view, you can extract the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Value |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Name** | `_fwd_kernel` |\n",
    "| **Category** | `kernel` |\n",
    "| **Stream** | `stream 3 (3)` |\n",
    "| **Process** | `python3 (2)` |\n",
    "| **Duration** | `788µs 256ns` |\n",
    "| **Launch delay** | `~819µs` from the CPU call |\n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel is part of the **multi-head attention forward pass**, one of the most compute-heavy operations in inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracing back to the CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the kernel details, near the preceding flows, you’ll find `hipModuleLaunchKernel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click this to jump back to the CPU thread (`python3 3906`), shown in blue in the image below, which issued this kernel launch. This feature is incredibly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mapping GPU operations to their Python or C++ call stack\n",
    "- Identifying bottlenecks in dispatch or synchronization\n",
    "- Understanding how long the CPU takes to enqueue work on the GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../assets/image_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the process above, you can track how much time each kernel takes in both the prefill and decode stage. A short summary for one kernel is shown in the chart below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](../assets/image_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Programmatic analysis and extracting the GPU kernel timeline with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To go beyond visual inspection, you can also parse the trace programmatically to list all GPU kernels and their durations. This is helpful when you're tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernel launch patterns\n",
    "- Duration spikes\n",
    "- Gaps or anomalies in execution\n",
