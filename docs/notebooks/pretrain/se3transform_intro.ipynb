        "# SE(3)-Transformer for molecular property prediction\n",

        "*Authored by: Anuya Welling, James E. T. Smith, Diptorup Deb, Mukhil Azhagan Mallaiyan Sathiaseelan, Yao Liu, Phani Vaddadi, and Vish Vadlamani*\n",
        "\n",
        "The [SE(3)-Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10503) is a graph neural network that uses a variant of self-attention for 3D points and graphs processing.\n",
        "This model is equivariant under continuous 3D roto-translations, which means that when the inputs (graphs or sets of points) rotate in 3D space\n",
        "(or more generally experience a proper rigid transformation), the model outputs either stay invariant or transform with the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the SE(3)-Transformer model, both training and inference are framed as regression tasks over a set of molecular properties. These include parameters such as μ, α, HOMO, LUMO, gap, R², ZPVE, U₀, U, H, G, and Cv, along with their atom-wise counterparts and rotational constants (A, B, C).\n",
        "\n",
        "While the full physical interpretation of many of these quantities is best left to subject matter experts, this tutorial focuses on a few key electronic properties that are commonly used in molecular modeling. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) refers to the highest energy level that is still occupied by electrons. LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) is the lowest energy level that does not contain electrons and is available for occupation. The HOMO–LUMO gap, often simply called \"the gap\", is the energy difference between these two orbitals and is an important indicator of a molecule's electronic and chemical behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "In drug discovery, SE(3)-Transformer models predict molecular properties that matter for real biological behavior. A good drug must bind strongly to its target, avoid off-target reactions, and remain stable in the body while being reactive at the right site.\n",
        "\n",
        "HOMO and LUMO capture this balance. They indicate a molecule's tendency to donate or accept electrons, which influences how it reacts with protein amino acids and whether it could be toxic. The HOMO–LUMO gap acts as a proxy for reactivity -- too small can mean instability and side effects, while too large can mean inactivity. Poor reactivity often leads to drug failure, even when binding looks promising.\n",
