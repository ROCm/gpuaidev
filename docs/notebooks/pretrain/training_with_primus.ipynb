    "# Training a model with Primus\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to pretrain the [Qwen2.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B) large language model (LLM) using ROCm on AMD GPUs by leveraging Primus. Primus is a unified and flexible training framework for AMD Instinct™ GPUs that's designed to support multiple training engine backends, including Megatron, to deliver scalable, high-performance model training. Performance acceleration is powered by [Primus-Turbo](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Primus-Turbo) and the ROCm libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primus with Megatron is designed to replace the [ROCm Megatron-LM training](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/training/benchmark-docker/megatron-lm.html) workflow. To learn how to migrate workloads from Megatron-LM to Primus with Megatron, see [Migrating workloads to Primus (Megatron backend) from Megatron-LM](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/training/benchmark-docker/previous-versions/megatron-lm-primus-migration-guide.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up and run training with Primus, take advantage of its performance optimizations, and gain practical experience in using Primus to streamline model training workflows."

    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AMD Instinct™ GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on a full node of AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs (eight MI300X GPUs). Ensure you are using AMD Instinct GPUs or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
