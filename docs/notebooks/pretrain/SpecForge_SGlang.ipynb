    "# SpecForge: Training speculative decoding models with SGLang\n",
    "\n",
    "Speculative decoding is a powerful technique to improve inter-token latency in memory-bound LLM inference, which needs to run two models in parallel. These are the *target model* (the main LLM model for the AI application) and the *small draft model* (a smaller, lightweight LLM that runs alongside it to help speed up inference for the main LLM). The small draft model is important in speculative decoding because its ability to correctly predict the tokens for target model acceptance is the key factor in whether the deployment will be successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SpecForge](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge), a purpose-built ecosystem for training draft models that integrate natively with SGLang, is an open-source application that is listed as a flagship project by the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS). This tutorial demonstrates how to run SpecForge draft model training and SGLang speculative decoding inference with the trained draft model on a system with an AMD Instinct™ MI300X GPU.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04/24.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "* **AMD Instinct GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU node with eight GPUs. Ensure you are using a node with eight AMD Instinct GPUs or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets [the official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.3+**:  This tutorial requires ROCm 6.3 or later. Install and verify ROCm by following the [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using the `amd-smi` command. AMD also provides prebuilt ROCm Docker images, for example, [ROCm PyTorch](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch), [ROCm Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04), and [ROCm Ubuntu 24.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04). You can use these prebuilt Docker images to reduce the effort of setting up a ROCm environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the `rocm-smi` command instead of `amd-smi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   newgrp docker\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Verify Docker is working correctly with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   docker run hello-world\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hugging Face API access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain an API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) for downloading models.\n",
    "* Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access the [Meta Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up the SpecForge environment \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will work on the prebuilt ROCm PyTorch image as an example. You can also try the other ROCm images.\n",

    "\n",
    "Launch the Docker container. Replace `/path/to/SpecForge_Project` with the full path to the directory on your host machine where the SpecForge code and model files are stored. This tutorial uses the [SGLang ROCm Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang/tags?name=rocm) to demonstrate SpecForge draft model training and SGLang speculative decoding inference. For better model training performance, you can also try the [ROCm PyTorch Training Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch-training/).\n",

    "```\n",
    "**Note**: This command mounts the current directory to the `/SpecForge` directory in the container. Ensure the notebook file is either copied to this directory before running the Docker command or uploaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment after it starts. Save the token or URL provided in the terminal output to access the notebook from your web browser. You can download this notebook from the [AI Developer Hub GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/gpuaidev).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install and launch Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Docker container, install Jupyter using the following command:\n",

    "``` bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",

    "**Note**: Ensure port `8888` is not already in use on your system before running the above command. If it is, you can specify a different port by replacing `--port=8888` with another port number, for example, `--port=8890`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install SpecForge\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly installing the [official SpecForge code](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge) also installs some non-AMD related GPU libraries, which is not recommended. To avoid this issue, pick up the correct [commit](https://github.com/zhangnju/SpecForge) and make some modifications.

    "## Speculative decoding draft model training\n",
    "\n",
    "SpecForge is a framework for training speculative decoding models so you can smoothly port them over to the SGLang serving framework to speed up your inference. It offers two methods of training the draft model: online and offline training. Online training freezes the target model and training draft model at same time, which generates auxiliary hidden states on the fly and needs multiple GPUs to achieve better performance. Offline training generates and saves the hidden states using the target model first and then trains the draft model in a separate process. Offline training requires as little as one GPU because it only needs to accommodate the draft model, but it needs a huge amount of disk space. For example, the UltraChat and ShareGPT datasets would need 12TB of storage. Due to the disk size of the AMD Instinct MI300X system, this tutorial uses online training to demonstrate SpecForge.  \n",
