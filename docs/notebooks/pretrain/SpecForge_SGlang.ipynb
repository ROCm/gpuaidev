    "# SpecForge: Training Speculative Decoding Models with SGLang\n",
    "\n",
    "Speculative decoding is a powerful technique which improves inter-token latency in memory-bound LLM inference,which needs to run two models in parallel: Target Model (the main LLM model to run for our AI application) and Small Draft Model (a smaller, lightweight LLM that runs alongside to help speed up the main LLM’s inference). Small draft model is important to speculative decoding, whether it can correctly predict the tokens for target model to accept, is the key factor for the success or failure of speculative decoding deployment. [SpecForge](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge), a purpose-built ecosystem for training draft models that integrate natively with SGLang, has been open source and listed as a flagship project in LMSYS. In this tutorial,we will demonstrate how to run SpecForge Draft model training and SGLang Speculative decoding inference with the trained draft model on a AMD MI300x GPU node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04/24.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04/24.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "* **AMD GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU node with 8 GPUs. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU node with 8 GPUs or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets [the official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.3**:  This tutorial requires ROCm6.3 or later version. Install and verify ROCm by following [the ROCm install guide] (https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using rocm-smi command. AMD has also provided the pre-built rocm docker images, for example, [rocm pytorch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch),[rocm ubuntu22.04 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04) and [rocm ubuntu24.04 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04). Developers can use these pre-built docker images to reduce the efforts of setting up ROCm environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   newgrp docker\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Verify Docker is working correctly with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   docker run hello-world\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hugging Face API access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain an API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) for downloading models.\n",
    "* Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access the [Meta Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up SpecForge environment \n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work on the pre-built ROCm pytorch images as the example. Developer can also try other ROCm images as their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Launch the docker image \n",
    "Launch the Docker container . Replace /path/to/SpecForge_Project with the full path to the directory on your host machine where the SpecForge codes and model files are stored. In this tutorial, we used[SGLang ROCm docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang/tags?name=rocm) to demonstrate SpecForge draft model training and SGlang speculative decoding inference. If you would like to have the better model training performance, you could also try [ROCm Pytorch Training Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/pytorch-training/)\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "**Note**: This command mounts the current directory to the `/SpecForge` directory in the container. Ensure the notebook file is either copied to this directory before running the Docker command or uploaded into the Jupyter Notebook environment after it starts. Save the token or URL provided in the terminal output to access the notebook from your web browser. You can download this notebook from the [AI Developer Hub GitHub repository](https://github.com/ROCm/gpuaidev).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install and launch Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Docker container, install Jupyter using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Jupyter server:\n",

    "jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Ensure port `8888` is not already in use on your system before running the above command. If it is, you can specify a different port by replacing `--port=8888` with another port number, for example, `--port=8890`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install SpecForge\n",
    "If we install [Official SpecForge codes](https://github.com/sgl-project/SpecForge) directly, we will also install some Non-AMD related GPU libraries on AMD GPU platform, which is not recommended. In order to avoid this issue, we pick up the right commit ,make some modifications, and then share the [codes](https://github.com/zhangnju/SpecForge) for this tutorial. You can install it from the source codes for this tutorial. Run the following commands inside the Jupyter notebook running within the Docker container:"

    "## Speculative decoding draft model training\n",
    "\n",
    "SpecForge is a framework for training speculative decoding models so that you can smoothly port them over to the SGLang serving framework to speed up your inference. It has offered two ways to train the draft model: online training and offline training. Online training means freezing target model and training draft model at same time, which generates auxiliary hidden states on the fly and needs multiple GPUs to have the better performance. Offline training means generating and saving the hidden states using the target model first and then training the draft model in a separate process, which GPU requirement as low as 1 GPU, as only need to accommodate the draft model,but it needs huge disk space,e.g. ultrachat and sharegpt datasets will need 12TB storage. Regarding to the disk size of AMD MI300x machine, we will use online training to demonstrate SpecForge in this tutorial.  \n",
