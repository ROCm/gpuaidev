    "# Pretrain Llama-3.1 8B with torchtitan\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to pretrain the Llama-3.1 8B large language model (LLM) on AMD ROCm GPUs by leveraging torchtitan. Torchtitan is a proof of concept for large-scale LLM training using native PyTorch. The repository showcases PyTorch's latest distributed training features in a clean, minimal codebase. Torchtitan is complementary to, and not a replacement for, other large-scale LLM training codebases such as Megatron, MegaBlocks, LLM Foundry, and DeepSpeed. For more information, see the [official torchtitan GitHub page](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan)."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial was developed and tested using the following setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ubuntu 22.04**: Ensure your system is running Ubuntu version 22.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AMD Instinct™ GPUs**: This tutorial was tested on an AMD Instinct MI300X GPU. Ensure you are using an AMD Instinct GPU or compatible hardware with ROCm support and that your system meets the [official requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ROCm 6.3**: Install and verify ROCm by following the [ROCm install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html). After installation, confirm your setup using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    amd-smi\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This command lists your AMD GPUs with relevant details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Note**: For ROCm 6.4 and earlier, use the `rocm-smi` command instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and configured correctly. Follow the Docker installation guide for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Ensure the Docker permissions are correctly configured. To configure permissions to allow non-root access, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ``` bash\n",
    "   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "   newgrp docker\n",

    "\n",
    "### Hugging Face API access\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain an API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) for downloading models.\n",
    "* Ensure the Hugging Face API token has the necessary permissions and approval to access the [Meta Llama checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
