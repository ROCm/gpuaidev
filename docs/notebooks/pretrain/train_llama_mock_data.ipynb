    "# Training Llama-3.1 8B with Megatron-LM \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to train the Llama-3.1 model using *mock data*. The Llama-3.1 8B model is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks efficiently. Learn more about the Llama models at [Llama's website](https://www.llama.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses mock data to provide a quick and lightweight demonstration of the training workflow, enabling you to verify that your environment is correctly configured and functional. Mock data is a useful way to validate the training pipeline without requiring large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process leverages the Megatron-LM framework, a specialized framework for pretraining and fine-tuning large-scale language models. For more information about Megatron-LM, see their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). All steps are executed within a Docker container, which provides a ready-to-use environment with all necessary dependencies.\n",

    "This tutorial builds on the setup completed in the [Pretraining with Megatron-LM tutorial](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/notebooks/pretrain/setup_tutorial.html)."
